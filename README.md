 # SuperMarket app

Hi my name is Snir.
I'm here to explain to you about the project you're about to see.
This app simulates supermarket shopping.
You can switch between departments and add and remove things from the shopping cart.
And finally pay at the checkout.
Do not forget to enter the amount of money you have :)
Wish you a pleasant use :)
